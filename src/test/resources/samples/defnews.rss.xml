                <![CDATA[<p>The U.S. will have fully cleared out of one air base in Niger as it continues to move personnel and equipment from the African country ahead of a September deadline to <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/newsletters/daily-news-roundup/2024/05/19/us-departure-from-niger-already-underway-ahead-of-september-deadline/" target="_blank">complete its withdrawal,</a> according to the head of U.S. Africa Command.</p><p>Niger and the U.S. announced their decision in a joint statement last month and set a deadline of Sept. 15 for the U.S. to move its forces out of the West African country. Ties between the two nations began to deteriorate last summer after a coup staged by a military junta known as the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland, or CNSP.</p><p>By March, a spokesman for the council said U.S. forces would no longer operate in the country.</p><p>“We are on pace and on plan, moving heavy equipment out of Air Base 101, and then we will conclude with Air Base 201,” U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Michael Langley told reporters in a June 24 press briefing.</p><p>“Within a few weeks, we’ll be done with 101. I’ll put it that way,” he added. “Heavy equipment, rolling stock, is always the biggest thing that we are getting out of there. … We’re right on pace if not ahead of the pace.”</p><p>America has relied on Niger as a counterterrorism hub for more than a decade. Until recently, more than 1,000 U.S. personnel have operated there, with most concentrated on an air base located in the center of the country, which <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2018/10/16/is-the-new-us-drone-base-in-niger-worth-the-cost/" target="_blank">cost more than $100 million</a>.</p><p>The plan for relocating equipment is not yet finalized, but Langley said he has made tours across coastal West Africa and the rest of the region to best understand what those countries need for addressing the counterterrorism fight they face.</p><p>“I look at our overall strategy. We’re doubling down on the strategy of going through our partners, by, with and through, on deterring threats and also crisis response. I don’t measure that in the amount of equipment, relocating equipment; I measure it by capabilities,” he said.</p><p>The commander stressed that these countries are not asking for U.S. troops on the ground in “any scope or magnitude. They say it’s their fight. They’re looking for capabilities, whether it be exquisite capabilities of intel sharing [or] being able to achieve the capability to identify indications and warnings for themselves.”</p><p>Acknowledging the presence of Russian advisers and trainers in Niger at Air Base 101 where Americans are still withdrawing, Langley said: “What intentions they have beyond that, I don’t know. ... But right now I know that we’re doing a responsible and graduated withdrawal.”</p><p>Russian military presence exists <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2024/04/19/russia-funneling-weapons-through-libyan-port-eying-gateway-to-africa/" target="_blank">as far north as Libya </a>and as far south as the Central African Republic, according to Langley.<a href="https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/ausa/2022/10/10/us-army-brigade-in-africa-seeks-to-ward-off-chinese-russian-influence/" target="_blank"> Russian activity</a> is likely to be a topic that comes up during the African Chiefs of Defense Conference, an annual forum set to kick off for the first time on the African continent in Botswana on June 25.</p><p>The Russian military in Africa is attempting, through active disinformation campaigns, to drive a wedge between the West and its African partners, according to Langley.</p><p>“Do [the Russians] really want to have helped these African countries to beat terrorism or try to build their governance into being more responsive to their public or civil society? I’m not seeing that. I’m seeing they’re trying to put a narrative out there that will sow a discord between our African partners and the West writ large,” he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>Derek Chollet, a senior State Department official nominated last year for the Pentagon’s top policy role, will become Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s new chief of staff.</p><p>Austin announced the decision in a statement Monday morning, calling Chollet “one of the most distinguished, far-sighted, and skillful national-security practitioners of his generation.”</p><p>The decision comes nearly two weeks after Austin’s longtime Chief of Staff Kelly Magsamen said she would leave her post in late June, after three and a half years in the role. It also puts to rest the long saga of Chollet’s nomination to lead the Pentagon’s policy shop, afflicted by personnel turnover since its former leader Colin Kahl left last summer.</p><p>Shortly after Kahl left, the White House submitted Chollet’s name to fill the role. But the confirmation stalled in the Senate, in large part due to Republican objections over his role in the Afghanistan pullout in 2021.</p><p>Those frustrations crescendoed last September in a contentious hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p><p>Since then there has been no progress in actually confirming Chollet. The decision to move him to the chief of staff role may also have to do with the calendar. There’s only seven months until January, when there could be a turnover in administrations depending on November’s election</p><p>Amanda Dory, a longtime Pentagon hand, is now serving as undersecretary of defense for policy on an acting basis.</p><p>Magsamen’s deputy, Caroline Zier, was initially set to take over the chief of staff role. Chollet, who has served in senior positions within the Pentagon before, will start in July.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Army will field more than 1,000 Switchblade 600 drones over the next year as part of Replicator — the Pentagon’s push to field thousands of uncrewed systems.</p><p>Gen. James Mingus, the Army’s vice chief of staff, revealed the quantity for the first time during a June 21 House Appropriations defense subcommittee hearing, hosted at the Defense Innovation Unit’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.</p><p>Built by AeroVironment, <a href="https://defensescoop.com/2024/02/02/switchblade-600-kamikaze-drones-replicator-mass-production/" target="_blank">the Switchblade 600 loitering munition</a> is one of a handful of systems the Defense Department plans to buy in the first tranche of the Replicator program and is the only one officials have identified by name. Others include an unspecified fleet of maritime drones procured through a DIU solicitation,<a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/05/06/pentagon-outlines-systems-funding-for-first-batch-of-replicator/" target="_blank"> a batch of uncrewed surface vehicles</a> and a set of counter-drone systems.</p><p>The intent of Replicator, which Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks announced last August, is twofold. In the near-term the Pentagon wants to field large numbers of attritable drones to counter China. But the larger goal is to develop an enduring process for buying technology to meet the department’s most urgent operational needs.</p><p>The Pentagon plans to spend a total of $1 billion on the effort in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 with funds drawn from various sources including prior year appropriations, a reprogramming request, a national security supplemental approved in August and the department’s yet-to-be approved FY-25 budget proposal.</p><p>Switchblade has featured heavily on battlefields in Russia, Syria and Iraq. The Army had already planned to buy the system through its Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance program, though in smaller quantities, before it was selected for Replicator. Last October, the service announced that it would procure 100 Switchblades to test and field within Army units.</p><p>“That was an innovation that we had worked collectively together, it’s a loitering munition, which we then included as part of Replicator Tranche One,” Mingus said during the hearing. “And we are now going to scale and scope that to over 1,000 over the next year or so.”</p><p>Hicks announced last month that the department <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/05/23/replicator-drones-already-being-delivered-pentagon-says/" target="_blank">started fielding Replicator systems to Indo-Pacific Command in early May</a>. The Pentagon declined to say what systems had been fielded nor would it disclose quantities.</p><p>“This shows that warfighter-centric innovation is not only possible; it’s producing real results,” Hicks said in a statement. “Even as we deliver systems, our end-to-end capability development process continues.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>Lockheed Martin said it demonstrated it can integrate digital command and control capabilities into the <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/it-networks/2024/05/01/marines-tech-chief-unveils-latest-network-command-and-control-effort/" target="_blank">Pentagon’s Joint Fires Network</a> during Valiant Shield, an exercise in Hawaii this month.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/opinion/2024/05/31/how-to-build-an-effective-information-network-in-the-indo-pacific/" target="_blank">Joint Fires Network</a> is a<a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/cyber/2023/03/27/us-indo-pacific-command-seeks-extra-274-million-for-cyber/" target="_blank"> U.S. Indo-Pacific Command </a>initiative to improve coordination between commanders and network any sensor from any platform to feed targeting guidance to any weapon system. Valiant Shield is focused on integrating forces across domains with thousands of U.S. military personnel participating along with 200 ships, aircraft and ground vehicles.</p><p>The JFN demonstration during Valiant Shield “integrated technologies with third-party capabilities as part of an enterprise architecture,” Lockheed said in a June 20 statement.</p><p>“The exercise showcased the seamless integration of Lockheed Martin’s advanced command and control functions, employing Operational Planning to coordinate real-time decision-making across the theater of operations, with all the Services and operational domains,” it said. “This approach enhanced the agility and responsiveness of joint operations, using live real-time data, and producing joint tasking orders in an operationally relevant environment.”</p><p>Lockheed’s digital C2 system combines its fielded battle management, command and control software with other technologies from industry, the company notes.</p><p>To participate in Valiant Shield, the company said it made improvements to its C2 Planning Software that included “streamlining operator workflows by making machine interactions intuitive, enabling real-time monitoring, and facilitating seamless integration with other technologies.”</p><p>The company also trained operators on high-fidelity mission simulators prior to the exercise to learn how to use the C2 planning system.</p><p>Lockheed has now participated in seven exercises to continue to work on refining its digital C2 capabilities, it said.</p><p>For example, the <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/battlefield-tech/c2-comms/2023/05/24/lockheed-paces-jadc2-information-sharing-at-northern-edge/" target="_blank">company participated in Northern Edge</a>, an experiment in the Indo-Pacific theater that demonstrated synchronization of technology that could feed into the Pentagon’s connect-everything-everywhere campaign called Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.</p><p>The company plans to continue to bring technology to exercises and demonstrations in the Indo-Pacific to help build joint, networked capability.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>The Defense Innovation Unit plans to spend most of its nearly $1 billion fiscal 2024 budget to accelerate existing projects and add new ones in technology areas like counter uncrewed aerial systems and space transport.</p><p>Congress <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/2024/03/21/defense-innovation-unit-would-get-major-funding-boost-in-spending-bill/" target="_blank">approved a nearly 10-fold funding increase</a> in FY24for the Pentagon’s commercial technology hub to support its expanding mission to help the Defense Department quickly foster and field commercial capabilities in large numbers. Prolonged budget deliberations <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2024/03/23/congress-passes-defense-spending-bill-after-months-of-delays/#:~:text=Congress%20early%20on%20Saturday%20passed,other%20agencies%20expired%20on%20Friday." target="_blank">delayed the release of appropriations</a>, which meant that DIU’s funding came more than five months into the fiscal year, presenting the organization with the challenge of using that money in a short period of time.</p><p>DIU Director Doug Beck has said the funding <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/unmanned/2024/04/23/defense-innovation-unit-prepares-to-execute-800-million-funding-boost/" target="_blank">would be split among four areas</a>: accelerating existing programs; launching new ones; supporting projects housed within other Defense Department innovation organizations; and addressing some of the challenges commercial companies face as they try to work with DoD.</p><p>In a June 20 statement, DIU said offered more details on that split, revealing that 50% of the funding — or about $491 million — would be directed toward speeding up its priority efforts. Another 25%, about $246 million, will fund new projects.</p><p>“While DIU has already begun putting the new budget into action, with Congressional oversight, over the next few months, DIU expects to release two dozen solicitations using our FY24 appropriations for new projects,” the organization said.</p><p>Existing priorities include technologies to support attritable uncrewed systems, <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/it-networks/2024/05/01/marines-tech-chief-unveils-latest-network-command-and-control-effort/" target="_blank">the Pentagon’s Joint Fires Network</a> and other space, cyber, energy, logistics and human systems efforts.</p><p>Along with space transport and Counter UAS, new projects will focus on cross-cutting software and advanced manufacturing with the goal of helping enable more resilient and integrated autonomous systems operating across multiple domains.</p><p>“DIU’s FY24 spending is concentrated on closing the U.S. military’s most critical operational capability gaps with the focus, speed, and scale required to help us deter major conflict or win if forced to fight,” Beck said in a statement.</p><p>The remaining 25% of funding will support DIU’s role in coordinating various Pentagon innovation organizations like the Air Force’s AFWERX and the Navy’s NavalX and breaking down “systemic barriers” to adopting non-traditional technology within the Pentagon. That includes expanding DIU’s network of OnRamp Hubs, which are based around the U.S.</p><p>“DIU, working with partners across the Department, will continue industry outreach through a variety of in-person and virtual engagements, providing informational content about how to work with DIU and, more broadly, how to better engage the DoD,” the organization said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>The U.S. moved Ukraine to the front of the line for its sales of air defense interceptors — one of the most critical weapons in Ukraine’s self-defense.</p><p>National Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced the reshuffle in a briefing today, calling it “difficult but necessary.” In the short-term, he said, Patriot and NASAM interceptors that had been slated for other countries will now go to Ukraine.</p><p>“As a result, deliveries for these missiles to other countries that are currently in the queue will have to be delayed,” Kirby said.</p><p>The White House expects Ukraine will receive these air defense weapons by the end of the summer. Kirby said the number will be in the hundreds, and that the decision should give Ukraine what it needs for the next 16 months. At that point, the countries who currently have air defense missiles on order can expect to start seeing theirs delivered.</p><p>“To be clear, those countries will still receive the missiles they have ordered,” Kirby said. “It’s just that the delivery will take a little longer.”</p><p>He did not say which countries would be affected by the delays, but noted that the decision will not impact Taiwan or Israel.</p><p>Lockheed Martin is <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/land/2024/04/09/how-companies-plan-to-ramp-up-production-of-patriot-missiles/" target="_blank">fully funded by the U.S. Army to build 550 PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles a year </a>at its Camden, Arkansas, production line and hit a rate of 500 per year in December 2023.</p><p>While the Army has yet to fund another missile production increase, Lockheed has invested internally to build 650 interceptors a year.</p><p>In 2023, Lockheed signed six letters of approval with international customers.</p><p>There are 19 countries with the Raytheon-made Patriot and that customer base is growing. Switzerland purchased five batteries and 75 missiles in November 2022 and Romania plans to buy additional fire units. At least two other European countries are close to announcing plans to buy Patriot, according to Raytheon this spring.</p><p>Slovakia has recently expressed interest in purchasing Patriot, and Germany has said it intends to grow its Patriot force.</p><p>The decision is one of the most extraordinary measures America has taken to protect Ukraine since the full-scale war with Russia began two years ago. For months, Pentagon leaders have said that air defense is at the top of the agenda for the countries supporting Kyiv. And they’ve taken recent steps to prove it.</p><p>“Air defense has been at the top of my agenda for a long time,” said U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at a June press conference.</p><p>Austin spoke at NATO headquarters in Brussels, shortly after a meeting of countries that gather each month to coordinate support for Ukraine. Just before the summit, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-patriot-missile-systems-us-aid-62deb8e2c4653dfc27949f81bfa43255">multiple outlets reported</a> that the U.S. was sending another Patriot system to Ukraine — though neither Austin nor Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown would confirm the news.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy said in June his country needs seven <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/land/2024/04/09/how-patriot-proved-itself-in-ukraine-and-secured-a-fresh-future/" target="_blank">Patriot systems</a>, one of the most advanced air defense systems in the world. Germany announced earlier this year that it would send one to Ukraine. The Netherlands similarly committed to assembling and sending another system.</p><p><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2023/12/13/norway-to-provide-more-air-defense-systems-to-ukraine/">Other countries have committed</a> different air defense systems altogether, such as NASAMS.</p><p>“It’s not just Patriots,” Austin said at the June presser, listing out other systems. “It’s a number of capabilities that Ukraine needs, and they need the interceptors to complement the platforms.”</p><h2>Short supply</h2><p>Despite their importance, both air defense batteries and the interceptors they fire are in short supply. The U.S. and its allies have spent much of the war sourcing whatever extra weapons are available — especially as Ukraine faced drone and missile barrages on its cities and critical infrastructure. The decision this week reflects how tight the supply chain for these systems is. Rather than expanding capacity, the U.S. has reordered it.</p><p>“It’s a reminder of the importance of expanding inventory,” said Tom Karako, an expert on air defense at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, of the decision.</p><p>Karako said that the money meant to expand that capacity included in <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/04/24/congress-sends-ukraine-israel-taiwan-aid-package-to-presidents-desk/" target="_blank">the April national security supplemental</a> — a massive refresh of security aid to Ukraine and other countries — hasn’t been spent yet. Though there is around $48 billion for military aid to Ukraine in the package, the amount marked for air defense isn’t specified, he said.</p><p>“You don’t just turn on a dime and start spitting out Patriots like a Xerox machine,” Karako said.</p><p>The White House didn’t specify what countries will be affected by the reshuffle, though Karako said that the likely candidates will be in Europe and the Middle East.</p><p>Kirby said that Washington would do what it could to shorten any delays.</p><p>Still, he said, “each country is going to have a different set of circumstances that apply to that based on what they’ve ordered and what their own self-defense needs are.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>House lawmakers want the Pentagon’s commercial technology hub to expand its partnerships with Israel and Taiwan to bolster the countries’ defense-industrial bases.</p><p>The proposals came in two separate amendments to the House’s version of fiscal 2025 defense policy legislation, which the panel adopted June 14. Both were put forward by Iowa Republican Rep. Zach Nunn.</p><p>The Taiwan provision calls for the Defense Innovation Unit to study the feasibility of establishing a <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/05/07/how-dc-became-obsessed-with-a-potential-2027-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan/" target="_blank">“strategic partnership” with the country’s ministry of defense.</a> That could include coordinating on things like defense industrial priorities and dual-use technology development as well as helping Taiwan establish pathways for startups research and development efforts.</p><p>The Israel amendment emphasizes similar opportunities, but also calls for DIU to work with the Israeli military to counter Iran’s development of dual-use defense technologies and “harmonize global posture through emerging technology.”</p><p>The U.S. has vowed support for both nations, sending Israel more than $12.5 billion since the start of its war with Hamas last October. In April, Congress approved $4 billion in aid to Taiwan and other Indo-Pacific partners <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/04/24/congress-sends-ukraine-israel-taiwan-aid-package-to-presidents-desk/" target="_blank">as part of a $95 billion package</a> that included funding for Ukraine and Israel.</p><p>The call to deepen that support through more collaboration on commercial technology comes as DIU looks to be<a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/2024/02/07/defense-innovation-units-tech-scaling-strategy-focuses-on-partnerships/" target="_blank"> more embedded with partners</a> around the globe — a key component of its vision for growth in the coming years,<a href="https://www.diu.mil/latest/diu-3-0-scaling-defense-innovation-for-strategic-impact" target="_blank"> a strategy called DIU 3.0</a>. The goal is to create a pathway for DIU innovation to be shared with allies who may also need it.</p><p>“We must connect the solutions created by U.S. tech companies to allied and partner acquisition organizations when appropriate — and connect capabilities developed by our partner nations’ companies to our own needs and to one another — especially in a conflict, when speed is critical,” according to the DIU 3.0 strategy, which was released in February.</p><p>As part of that effort, DIU is bolstering its relationships with existing innovation initiatives in partners countries — including India, the United Kingdom and Australia — and helping those without such organizations to establish them.</p><p>DIU is also embedding itself within the Defense Department’s combatant commands. To date, it has units in five of the seven COCOMs.</p><p>Matthew Way, who leads DIU’s counter uncrewed aerial systems portfolio, said these partnerships with combatant commands not only bring the organization closer to the operators but they also give commanders another tool to leverage technology from commercial and non-traditional companies.</p><p>For example, DIU is heavily involved in U.S. Indo-Pacific Command’s Joint Mission Accelerator Directorate, which is designed to ensure the command’s top priority technology projects have a network of support within DOD and industry.</p><p>“That’s really helped flatten communications,” Way said during Applied Intuition’s June 13 Nexus Conference in Washington, D.C. “The way we approach our problem sets is really working with combatant commands and end users.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>The Pentagon’s fast-track pathway for buying equipment often doesn’t move any faster than the normal process, according to a new report from the government’s watchdog agency.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106831.pdf" target="_blank">Government Accountability Office unveiled its annual report</a> on the Defense Department’s buying practices, covering many of the largest items in the military’s shopping cart, from aircraft carriers to intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p><p>GAO studied more than 30 of the most expensive items on order, costing a little more than $1 trillion. The total cost of those fell by about $1.7 billion since the year before, due to changes in inflation and a drop in purchases.</p><p>Still, several of these big-ticket items are running above the contracted price. The estimated total may rise, the report warned, plus there are issues with speed.</p><p>For the largest weapons programs still awaiting delivery, it’s taking 10 years for the Pentagon to place an order and then receive the system. That’s longer than the average noted last year.</p><p>But for programs that have started delivering, the delays are even longer. The average time, the authors found, rose from 8 years to 11 years.</p><p>Alongside these major programs, GAO also studied some meant to be smaller and more nimble. These “middle-tier acquisitions,” or MTA, work like a toll road alongside a highway — a quicker route for weapons that the Pentagon needs more urgently.</p><p>The trouble is that the speed limit isn’t much faster, the report found.</p><p>“Although the MTA pathway was designed for speed, GAO found most MTA programs do not plan to implement leading practices to facilitate that speed,” it said.</p><p>These programs are meant to reach the field within five years, according to the Pentagon’s own guidance. However, GAO found some middle-tier programs are still following a “linear” process: five years for prototyping and another five for development.</p><p>“While the MTA pathway offers flexibilities to create efficiencies in the acquisition process, the warfighter may continue to wait years — if not more than a decade — for a solution that may ultimately no longer be relevant,” according to the report.</p><p>One of the core problems the Pentagon faces as it tries to buy weapons moving forward is purchasing software. Weapons, like technology more broadly, depend more on the lines of code that make them work. To avoid going obsolete, that software must stay up to date.</p><p>But the DOD struggles to buy this evergreen technology, and one of the reasons listed in the report is employees. The department doesn’t have enough people who understand software, the report argued. Instead, many of the most software-intense programs in the Pentagon require the expertise of contractors.</p><p>“DOD has taken initial steps to establish a cadre of personnel with software expertise, but its efforts are in early stages,” the report said. “While DOD expects to request more funding, as of March 2024, the cadre consisted of one federal employee with limited assistance.”</p><p>GAO offered three main recommendations: strategies to make MTA programs move faster, clearer guidance on the Pentagon’s software workforce, and the funding and goals needed for that workforce.</p><p>The top deputy for Pentagon acquisition and sustainment, who has since moved to a policy role, partially agreed with the recommendations and said some may be included in the DOD’s next update to its buying practices, expected this month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>House and Senate lawmakers on Friday offered a preview of this summer’s fight over defense policy changes for next year, with <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2024/05/29/powerful-gop-senator-eyes-ships-jets-nukes-in-defense-spending-surge/" target="_blank">overall military spending</a> and <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/06/11/junior-enlisted-pay-bump-to-cost-as-much-as-two-new-aircraft-carriers/" target="_blank">troop pay raises</a> hanging in the balance.</p><p>Members of the<a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/06/10/senators-take-up-defense-bill-work-this-week-but-out-of-public-view/" target="_blank"> Senate Armed Services Committee</a> unveiled their draft of the massive defense authorization bill Friday morning, just as <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/05/23/house-advances-884-billion-defense-bill-with-enlisted-troop-pay-raise/" target="_blank">House lawmakers</a> narrowly adopted their version of the measure, mostly along party lines in a 217-199 vote.</p><p>After the full Senate amends its committee’s draft over the next few weeks, the two chambers will begin negotiations over a compromise bill to send to the president’s desk later this year.</p><p>The legislation, which has passed Congress annually for more than 60 years, includes a host of pay authorizations, program changes and policy updates that impact almost every corner of the Defense Department. As such, the bill is closely watched by Pentagon planners and military advocates all year long, and it commands significant attention from lawmakers both on and off the military oversight committees.</p><p>Here’s a look at the major differences in the House and Senate bills, and the debates ahead.</p><h2>Total defense spending</h2><p>While the authorization bill doesn’t provide direct funding for military operations (the annual appropriations bill does that), the <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2024/05/29/powerful-gop-senator-eyes-ships-jets-nukes-in-defense-spending-surge/" target="_blank">overall spending levels</a> prescribed in the measure typically set the tone for debate over how much money the Defense Department will get next year.</p><p>In the House, that total is about $884 billion, in line with a debt ceiling agreement between the White House and Congress last summer to cap spending increases for fiscal 2025 at 1%.</p><p>The Senate authorization bill comes in at $923 billion, a 5% boost in overall defense spending, including $12.5 billion in emergency funding for military disaster recovery construction in Guam following Typhoon Mawar last year.</p><img src="https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/FytmUl-mAWP7ZuiKTnS8yIBBl3M=/1440x810/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/NBY3HRNFLJCVXOMNVTCBZ2D3KA.jpg" alt="U.S. Air Force personnel search the grass for debris from Typhoon Mawar at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam on Oct. 25, 2023. The base sustained severe damage. (Senior Airman Kaitlyn Preston/U.S. Air Force)" height="810" width="1440"/><p>The roughly $25 billion extra in non-Guam funding provided in the Senate bill would allow the Defense Department to pursue several additional shipbuilding, procurement and military construction priorities.</p><p>“If you look at this bill overall, you would definitely see that the pivot to the Indo-Pacific is also a pivot to sea power, and more and more focus is going to be on the sea power investments,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who chairs the committee’s sea power panel, told reporters after the markup.</p><p>For instance, the extra spending in the bill partially helps fund a second Virginia-class attack submarine against the Navy’s wishes; the service requested a single attack submarine for FY25 due to production delays in the industrial base. The Senate bill authorizes $1.1 billion in partial funding for the second submarine, slightly more than the House version.</p><p>The Senate bill also allows for an extra $4 billion in munitions procurement across the services, including to expand capacity for production lines for items like the Precision Strike Missile as well as the Standard Missile-2 and -6 weapons.</p><p>Another $3.1 billion would go toward military construction projects for the unfunded priorities lists submitted by various services and combatant commands.</p><p>Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the top Republican on the committee, successfully offered the amendment to increase defense spending beyond the FY25 debt ceiling caps, arguing that the U.S. needs to spend more on the military to compete with China and Russia. However, the increase was less than the extra $55 billion he initially sought for FY25.</p><p>The committee’s chairman, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., voted against his panel’s authorization plan because of the high spending total. But a majority of Republicans and Democrats on the committee backed the increase in a 22-3 vote. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also voted against it.</p><p>Negotiating a final defense spending total will likely involve input from the White House and chamber fights over nondefense program funding, potentially complicating and lengthening the compromise process.</p><h2>Junior enlisted pay raises</h2><p>House lawmakers made quality of life for younger service members a major focus of their authorization bill, highlighted by a 15% average pay raise for troops E-4 and below. Supporters say the move will raise basic pay for all troops above $30,000, an adjustment meant to ensure military families aren’t facing financial strain while serving.</p><p>But the <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/06/11/white-house-takes-aim-at-shipbuilding-other-measures-in-defense-bill/" target="_blank">White House</a> has strongly opposed the targeted pay boost, which could cost about $3 billion next year and more than $24 billion over the next five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p><p>Administration officials back a 4.5% pay raise across the board for all troops (both the House and Senate also support that) but advised waiting on extra money for enlisted troops until next year, after a Pentagon study on military compensation is complete.</p><img src="https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/1WjawX7v7u-tO6eOdrqqmkWXldY=/1440x810/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/P7LHWT6U25GNZFS6LHP3UITBHY.jpg" alt="Family members of the crew on the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan see off the vessel on May 16, 2024, in Japan. (Eugene Hoshiko/AP)" height="810" width="1440"/><p>Despite including more overall defense funding in their bill, Senate lawmakers only offered<a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/06/12/junior-enlisted-would-see-only-a-small-pay-boost-under-senate-plan/" target="_blank"> an extra 1% boost for troops</a> E-3 and below on top of the across-the-board pay raise.</p><p>That would give most junior enlisted troops a few hundred dollars extra next year, as opposed to the several thousand dollars in salary increases in the House plan. However, Senate officials also added an extra $1 billion to potentially boost junior enlisted pay even further. The committee still needs to work out the details of those pay table changes.</p><p>Sorting out which plan survives congressional negotiations could have a major impact on young military families’ finances.</p><p>And that’s not the only pocketbook issue to be discussed by negotiators. House lawmakers also backed increases to service members’ housing stipends that were omitted by Senate bill authors. And the House draft includes an expansion of the military Basic Needs Allowance, money designed to provide additional support to families struggling to cover food and household costs.</p><h2>Social issues</h2><p>Most of the social issues expected to cause controversy in bill negotiations this summer come from the House draft of the authorization bill.</p><p>In floor work this week, Republican lawmakers added riders ending the Pentagon’s <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/06/13/gop-green-lights-fy25-defense-bill-but-more-social-fights-ahead/" target="_blank">abortion access policy for troops stationed in states where the procedure is outlawed</a>. They also included provisions to freeze hiring for diversity jobs in the military, limit care for transgender troops, and bar discussion of “radical gender ideology” or ”critical race theory” in training sessions.</p><p>Those moves drew the ire of Democratic lawmakers in the House, many of whom backed the bill when it came out of committee but opposed it because of what they called tangential social issue fights.</p><p>Republicans did not need Democratic support to advance the bill out of the House, but will need to reach a compromise on those issues in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Similar provisions included in last year’s House drafts were ultimately stripped out by negotiators.</p><p>The Senate draft again includes a push to require women to register for the Selective Service System, currently only mandated for men aged 18 through 25. House members have opposed that idea in recent years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>The House Appropriations Committee on Thursday advanced its fiscal 2025 defense spending bill while adding a provision that would eliminate the military’s makeshift pier off the coast of the Gaza Strip, which has struggled to deliver an adequate level of humanitarian aid to Palestinians facing famine-like conditions.</p><p>The committee voted 34-25 along party lines to send <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2024/06/05/defense-spending-bill-forces-israel-arms-transfers-nixes-ukraine-aid/" target="_blank">the $833 billion bill</a> to the House floor with Democrats objecting to the provision that would shut down the pier, which will cost anywhere between $230 and $320 million according to Pentagon estimates.</p><p>The amendment from Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., bans the Defense Department from building or maintaining a pier or <a href="https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2024/05/16/militarys-novel-floating-pier-arrives-in-gaza-amid-security-concerns/#:~:text=Troops%20move%20a%20trident%20pier,relief%20workers%20will%20oversee%20distribution." target="_blank">Joint-Logistics-Over-the-Shore capabilities</a> “in the vicinity of Gaza.”</p><p>“The pier has been plagued by prolonged delays, hijacked humanitarian aid, additional costs and debilitating damages,” Clyde said ahead of the vote. “President [Joe] Biden’s Gaza pier has been a total failure. It’s not provided anywhere near the expected amount of aid to the Palestinians as promised by this administration.”</p><p>The Appropriations Committee adopted Clyde’s amendment by voice vote over objections from Democrats, who also opposed the final bill due to a series of<a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/06/13/gop-green-lights-fy25-defense-bill-but-more-social-fights-ahead/" target="_blank"> socially conservative policy riders</a> and a lack of Ukraine aid.</p><p>Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the committee, noted that the Defense Department does not intend to continue its Gaza pier operation through FY25, which begins in October.</p><p>“A month ago, the head of the United Nations World Food Program announced that northern Gaza has entered a full-blown famine,” said McCollum. “This operation is only for a limited period of time and it ends in August when the weather and the seas will make it untenable to continue.”</p><p>Democrats on the Appropriations Committee also criticized a provision in the defense spending bill that bans funding for United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Another provision in the bill would prevent the president from withholding weapons deliveries to Israel and force the Pentagon to deliver the single shipment of roughly 3,500 air-to-ground munitions that Biden withheld in April.</p><p>Lawmakers on Wednesday also added two other amendments defunding the Gaza pier to <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/05/23/house-advances-884-billion-defense-bill-with-enlisted-troop-pay-raise/#:~:text=The%20House%20on%20Wednesday%20night,and%20Air%20Force%20procurement%20plans." target="_blank">the FY25 defense policy bill</a>, separate legislation that the full House is expected to vote on Friday. The House adopted the provisions from Republican Reps. Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Warren Davidson of Ohio as part of a bipartisan package of amendments that both parties agreed to by voice vote.</p><p>The House on Wednesday added another amendment to the defense policy bill by voice vote that would bar the Defense Department from using funds to rebuild Gaza, though there’s no money allocated to do so in the defense spending bill. Lawmakers adopted the amendment from from Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., by voice vote over Democratic objections.</p><p>The House narrowly passed another Mast amendment 204-199 that would bar the Pentagon from evacuating Palestinian refugees to the United States, though the Defense Department has no plans to undertake such an operation.</p><p>Biden announced the pier to deliver aid to Gaza during his <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/03/08/biden-outlines-military-plans-to-build-port-in-gaza-for-aid/" target="_blank">State of the Union address in March</a> because of Israel’s ongoing restrictions on food, water, fuel and medicine deliveries through the land crossings. The pier sits on the coast at the end of the Israeli military’s Netzarim Corridor, which now divides the Gaza Strip in two.</p><p>Twenty <a href="https://www.savethechildren.net/news/gaza-new-crossing-points-and-floating-dock-are-cosmetic-changes-humanitarian-access" target="_blank">aid agencies warned in May</a> that deliveries from the pier have been inadequate to compensate for the low level of assistance through land crossings. And the UN World Food Program <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/10/gaza-food-aid-un-pause-pier-israel" target="_blank">recently paused distribution of aid</a> from the pier, citing safety concerns for its staff after rocket attacks on its warehouses.</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2024/05/23/three-us-troops-on-gaza-pier-mission-sustain-non-combat-injuries/" target="_blank">three U.S. troops sustained noncombat injuries in May</a> while setting up the pier. Shortly thereafter, <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2024/06/09/aid-is-delivered-to-gaza-from-newly-repaired-us-built-pier/#:~:text=The%20pier%20constructed%20by%20the,repaired%20at%20an%20Israeli%20port." target="_blank">adverse weather conditions tore the pier apart</a> and forced the military to repair it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>
                <![CDATA[<p>A House Oversight Committee panel that is investigating the safety and oversight of the V-22 Osprey aircraft following a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/osprey-japan-crash-house-hearing-dfea6299444d65ad8900965e80daaf66">string of fatal crashes</a> has not received critical data or accident reports that its members requested months ago, two committee staffers told The Associated Press.</p><p>The aircraft, subject of a hearing Wednesday, has faced safety, maintenance and reliability issues for decades, with 62 service members and civilians killed in 12 Osprey accidents since 1992. The most recent was a crash off the coast of Japan in November that killed eight U.S. service members and led the military to ground the entire fleet. The aircraft, which can fly long distances fast like an airplane but land like a helicopter, began returning to service in March with flight restrictions.</p><p>Among the information that the House Oversight Committee’s Subcommittee on National Security, the Border and Foreign Affairs has requested but has yet to receive is the wear and replacement rates on Osprey <a href="https://apnews.com/article/osprey-crash-clutch-grounded-accidents-explainer-5d81b361e3d1e43402f6727341515668">proprotor gearboxes</a>, a component that was a factor in the 2023 crash off Japan.</p><p>Committee members also have asked for internal crash reports that the military conducts with surviving air and ground crews and witnesses. The reports, known as safety investigation board reports, aren’t available to the public and cannot be used to punish a crew — they are in place to identify and quickly share any safety issues among the fleet.</p><p>To date, the staffers said they had received about 3,500 pages of documents, but information was redacted, leaving them unable to conduct oversight. The committee staffers spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p><p>The staffers said the documents they have reviewed left them concerned about whether Pentagon leadership has maintained a close watch on the Osprey program. Some of the problems with the aircraft date back a decade or more but still haven’t been fixed.</p><p>After mechanical and material failures led to an Osprey crash in California in 2022 that killed five Marines, the military said it had instituted changes to prevent the issue from happening again.</p><p>“However, the recent fatal crash and ongoing investigations suggest that more transparency and rigorous testing is needed to verify these claims,” U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the committee, said in a statement to the AP ahead of the hearing Wednesday.</p><p>Testifying before lawmakers will be Vice Admiral Carl Chebi, head of the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command, which is responsible for the Osprey program across the military.</p><p>The committee is concerned about how the Pentagon will be able to sustain the Osprey program long term. Parts are wearing out faster than anticipated, but recent operations and maintenance budget requests by the Pentagon for the aircraft have been cut, Grothman said.</p><p>The Marine Corps is planning on using the Osprey through 2050, while Air Force Special Operations Command has already begun to talk publicly about finding another type of aircraft to conduct missions.</p><p>Osprey producers Bell Flight, the Boeing Co. and Rolls-Royce, which supplies the engines, are facing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/osprey-crash-v22-marines-lawsuit-8a2f73924640c267bd56e10a29465808">a new lawsuit</a> from families of the five Marines killed in the 2022 California crash. The lawsuit alleges that the companies did not address known parts failures or safety issues that were a factor in the crash.</p><p>Boeing and Bell have declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation.</p><p>The most recent crash last year in Japan was the fourth in two years which killed a total of 20 service members. The Air Force quickly identified that a material <a href="https://apnews.com/article/osprey-crash-clutch-grounded-accidents-explainer-5d81b361e3d1e43402f6727341515668">problem</a> with the aircraft was to blame for last year’s crash, and within a week, the entire Osprey fleet — hundreds of aircraft across the Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force — were grounded.</p><p>The staffers said the Pentagon has not provided details on what the restrictions are as the aircraft returns to operations.</p><p>The V-22 Osprey is loved by pilots because of its speed and ability to land on target like a helicopter. Besides the deadly crashes, there have been additional accidents in which the aircraft were destroyed and service members were injured, but all survived.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>As the U.S. and its allies and partners in the Pacific face down an increasingly aggressive China, a bi[artisan bill introduced in the Senate aims to strengthen the relationship between the U.S. and key countries in the region in order to better<a href="https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/global-force-symposium/2023/04/07/army-readies-for-record-setting-logistics-exercise-in-pacific/" target="_blank"> protect supply lines and ensure sustained operations, </a>should a conflict occur.</p><p>Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, of Utah, who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, and Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, of Arizona, a member of the Armed Services Committee co-introduced the proposed legislation today.</p><p>“With each passing day, China’s military continues to improve and expand its capabilities.” Romney said in a statement to Defense News. “The Chinese Communist Party’s ambitions are clear. In the event of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific, the United States could face challenges effectively moving personnel and equipment in an area that comprises about half of the earth’s surface.”</p><p>The legislation “will help us address vulnerabilities and maintain our readiness in contested environments. By strengthening partnerships in the Indo-Pacific, we can better support our troops and uphold our commitments to our allies in the region,” Kelly added in the statement.</p><p>The bill would require increased oversight over the U.S. military’s various efforts to conduct logistics and sustainment in a contested environment and also lays the groundwork for increased partnerships specifically for maintenance and repair with allies and partners in the Pacific.</p><p>The Defense Department has been working on how to tackle contested logistics from fort to port to foxhole, but the bill would require a review and a report be submitted to Congress accounting for all of the various efforts across military departments.</p><p>The legislation would require the secretary of defense to assess each military services’ role within the joint force in a contested logistics environment, the bill states. Specifically, a review would focus on the services’ ability to effectively maintain and repair capabilities, preposition or store materials needed to surge capability or support operations, examine the ability to repair and maintain without dedicated maintenance facilities, and figure out the resources needed to “reduce or mitigate the risks associated with operations in a contested logistics environment.”</p><p>A report would be due no later than one year following the enactment of the act.</p><h1>Local supply chain</h1><p>Additionally, while Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. are all able to <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2023/10/09/us-army-relies-on-pacific-allies-exercises-to-sustain-supply-lines/" target="_blank">provide product support to the U.S. in a contested logistics environment </a>such as transferring spare parts to the U.S. in order to more efficiently repair equipment in conflict, the bill would require Japan and South Korea to be included in that group of allies.</p><p><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/04/10/us-japan-announce-generational-upgrade-to-alliance-amid-china-threat/" target="_blank">Japan and the U.S. recently took new steps to strengthen its relationship</a>, vowing to improve command-and-control systems, form an industrial council to build weapons together, network their missile defense systems with Australia’s and start a joint exercise in the United Kingdom.</p><p>South Korea and the U.S. are also <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2024/02/06/south-korea-us-explore-joint-ship-weapons-maintenance-opportunities/" target="_blank">exploring whether the country’s defense industry could help</a> maintain, repair and overhaul American warships and weapons.</p><p>Lastly, the proposed legislation would authorize the Defense Department to conduct maintenance on certain surface vessels in foreign ports under a U.S. Navy pilot program called<a href="https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2024/01/30/us-navy-works-on-war-response-plan-amid-red-sea-ship-surge/" target="_blank"> Ship Wartime Repair and Maintenance, or SWaRM.</a></p><p>In order to ensure ships can be repaired quickly and easily at foreign ports, the Navy’s SWaRM pilot program aims to test out the process of undergoing repairs away from U.S. ports and would allow the service to figure out how to navigate the contracting process, allowing foreign workers to work on American ships and ensuring those workers are trained in accordance with American standards and regulations.</p><p>Keeping ships operational to deliver capability to ports throughout the Pacific is critical to sustaining Navy readiness, the bill emphasizes.</p><p>The U.S. Army is also considering, <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/land/2024/05/22/pacific-exercises-help-to-shape-us-armys-watercraft-strategy/" target="_blank">as a part of its watercraft strategy</a> still taking shape, how it might use ships, even commercial ones under contract, from allies and partners.</p><h1>‘Mesh network of friends’</h1><p>The Pentagon as well as the individual services have been ringing the alarm bells to ensure the U.S. is ready to supply and sustain the force in conflict in the Pacific. The Pacific accounts for over a quarter of the globe and the vast distances the U.S. must travel to within the theater creates an enormous challenge alone.</p><p>The U.S. Army has been working to adapt <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/ausa/2022/10/11/us-army-materiel-command-tasked-to-ramp-up-joint-logistics-in-pacific/" target="_blank">its approach to logistics to prepare for possible conflict with China</a> but also deter it from increased aggression in the region. The service recognized contested logistics as a key contribution to its Multidomain Operations doctrine published in 2022 in a special annex and created a <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/land/2023/10/09/what-is-the-us-armys-new-contested-logistics-team-working-on/" target="_blank">contested logistics cross-functional team</a> in 2023 to develop capabilities critical to operations where projecting, supplying, maintaining and sustaining the force will be contested across the board by near peer adversaries.</p><p>The U.S. military has been working with allies and partners to create capability through exercises like <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/global-force-symposium/2023/04/07/army-readies-for-record-setting-logistics-exercise-in-pacific/" target="_blank">Talisman Sabre in Australia, </a>Operation Pathways and RIMPAC. These exercises give the U.S. the opportunity to see what ports might be ideal for delivering supplies via watercraft and where weapons and supplies can be kept on a more permanent basis.</p><p>The Army has been building a “mesh network of friends, partners and allies,” Lt. Gen. Xavier Brunson, who commands the service’s I Corps, said last fall.</p><p><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/land/2024/05/16/four-ways-us-armys-pacific-chief-plans-to-boost-regional-land-forces/" target="_blank">Relationships are growing and strengthening, </a>U.S. Army Pacific commander, Gen. Charles Flynn, emphasized in May at a conference in Hawaii. Flynn noted in his speech that the opportunity to increase multilateral cooperation is the highest he has ever seen.</p><p>Commanders are working on strategies to lighten the logistics tail in contested environments and keep more capability forward in theater.</p><p>Conversations are ongoing with foreign partners about the possibility of tapping local industry in the Pacific to provide repair parts, supplies (even blood) and other capabilities, arrangements that are likely to be essential when the U.S. cannot rely on bringing everything with it to respond to a crisis or conflict.</p><p>Following Talisman Sabre, for instance, the U.S. military was given permission to leave behind equipment in prepositioned stock in Australia.</p><p>“As logisticians, we need to be successful and to understand the theater and to really set conditions for those joint interior lines,” Maj. Gen. Jered Helwig, <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/video/2023/10/11/army-theater-sustainment-commander-on-tackling-tough-logistics-in-indo-pacific/" target="_blank">the Army’s 8th Theater Sustainment Command commander</a> in the Pacific, said last fall “and build out that architecture that we know that, if we don’t rehearse in competition, will be very difficult to execute in crisis.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>The White House on Tuesday released a statement taking aim at several measures in the House’s fiscal 2025 defense policy bill ahead of votes scheduled for later this week.</p><p>While the statement praised the House Armed Services Committee for its “strong, bipartisan” work on <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/05/14/house-defense-bill-retains-spending-caps-creates-dod-talent-officer/" target="_blank">the $884 billion bill</a>, it raised objections to some of its provisions on shipbuilding, the creation of an Army drone corps, missile defense and pricing transparency for defense contractors.</p><p>The White House also said it “strongly urges” Congress to create <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/05/21/pentagon-asks-congress-for-indo-pacific-security-assistance-initiative/" target="_blank">an Indo-Pacific Security Assistance Initiative</a>, which the bill does not include despite a Pentagon request. The Pentagon’s proposal would mirror a similar program used to arm Ukraine.</p><p>“The administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress to set appropriate and responsible levels of defense and non-defense spending to support the security of the nation,” according to the statement from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. “The administration looks forward to working with Congress to address our concerns.”</p><p>Despite its specific objections, the White House did not issue a veto threat on the bill. That could change if the House adopts some of the socially conservative policy riders introduced by the right-flank of the Republican caucus during amendment votes later this week.</p><p>Republicans opted for this approach last year with <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2023/07/14/house-narrowly-passes-defense-bill-after-dems-defect-over-abortion/" target="_blank">a bill that only narrowly passed the House</a> after they voted to add amendments from the right-wing Freedom caucus that turned the usually bipartisan bill into a partisan endeavor. Lawmakers dropped those provisions during conference negotiations with the Senate before <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2023/12/14/congress-passed-the-fy24-defense-policy-bill-heres-whats-inside/" target="_blank">passing a bipartisan compromise bill for FY24</a> in December.</p><p>The Senate Armed Services Committee is set to mark up its version of the FY25 defense policy bill later this week.</p><p>House Armed Services Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the committee’s top Democrat, both asked the Rules Committee on Tuesday to focus on non-divisive provisions as they decide which of the 1,386 proposed amendments to put on the floor for votes.</p><p>“The bill we are presenting today is truly bipartisan,” said Rogers, noting his committee advanced it 57-1 last month. “As you consider which amendments to make in order, I would respectfully request that you focus on amendments that advance the security of our nation and the needs of our servicemembers.”</p><p>And Smith said that “any effort to go after reproductive healthcare, any effort to go after the rights of the LGBTQ community, are going be problems, as is any effort to block the efforts of DoD to have a truly inclusive military.”</p><h2>Shipbuilding loggerheads</h2><p>In addition to possible partisan divides over social issues, the Armed Services Committee has found itself at loggerheads with defense appropriators over their draft spending bill that overrides numerous provisions in the defense policy bill.</p><p>For instance, the <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2024/06/05/defense-spending-bill-forces-israel-arms-transfers-nixes-ukraine-aid/" target="_blank">draft FY25 defense spending bill</a> – which the Appropriations Committee is set to mark up on Thursday – <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/06/04/house-defense-spending-bill-nixes-funding-for-second-virginia-sub/" target="_blank">does not fund the policy bill’s $1 billion authorization in incremental funding for a second Virginia-class attack submarine</a>.</p><p>In doing so, defense appropriators have sided with the White House and Navy in <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2024/03/11/us-navy-nixed-a-virginia-sub-amid-spending-frenzy-to-support-suppliers/" target="_blank">their decision to fund the procurement of just one Virginia-class submarine for FY25</a> due to production delays instead of the usual two vessels.</p><p>“The authorization of incremental funding for a second [Virginia-class submarine] would result in a significant unplanned bill in FY26, competing for funding with additional [submarine industrial base investments] and Columbia-class submarines,” noted the White House statement. “This will force the Navy to make reductions in other priorities to accommodate the balance of funds for the second FY25″ submarine.</p><p>Instead, the Biden administration “encourages Congress to fully support the near-term submarine industrial base investments proposed in the president’s FY25 budget request.”</p><p>Authorizers on the Armed Services Committee argue the decision to drop a second Virginia-class vessel in FY25 will set back companies further down the submarine supply chain. At the same time, the defense policy bill<a href="https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2024/01/11/frigate-program-delayed-as-shipyard-is-a-few-hundred-workers-short/" target="_blank"> cuts $1.17 billion in procurement of a frigate for FY25</a> – drawing further objections from the White House.</p><p>Additionally, the White House took aim at a provision that would block the retirement of guided-missile cruisers.</p><p>“Divesting ships on a case-by-case basis allows the Navy to prioritize investments,” noted the statement. “The USS Shiloh and USS Lake Erie are currently in a condition that renders modernization and restoration to full operational capability cost-prohibitive.”</p><h2>Army and missile defense</h2><p>The White House also said it “strongly opposes” a provision in the defense policy bill <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/unmanned/uas/2024/05/17/drone-corps-proposal-would-disrupt-us-army-plans-says-undersecretary/" target="_blank">creating a drone corps within the Army</a>, arguing it “would create an unwarranted degree of specialization and limit flexibility to employ evolving capabilities.”</p><p>Additionally, it “strongly opposes” another provision requiring the establishment of a third continental missile interceptor site on the east coast by 2030.</p><p>“There is no operational need for such a site to protect the homeland against potential ballistic missiles originating from Iran or” North Korea, noted the statement.</p><p>Instead, the White House notes that the Defense Department will field 20 Next-Generation Interceptors in silos in Alaska by 2028 to defend all 50 states.</p><h2>Defense contractor pricing data</h2><p>Another provision the White House “strongly opposes” raises the cap at which prime defense contractors must obtain certified cost or pricing data from a subcontractor to $5 million, up from the current $2 million.</p><p>“This would reduce the incentive for sole-source prime contractors to negotiate contracts with their subcontractors, such as for spare parts, to keep costs under control, creating unnecessary risk for taxpayers,” notes the White House statement.</p><p>The Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group, is also lobbying against this provision.</p><p>Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, the group’s senior government affairs manager, said the provision would allow prime contractors to provide the Pentagon with “historical data, which is old data, and wouldn’t justify the current price hike.”</p><p>“That makes the contracting officers’ jobs even harder when they’re trying to figure out if the price is reasonable and fair – and they already have a hard time trying to figure that out under the current system,” Hedtler-Gaudette told Defense News.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>PARIS — The U.S. announced another package of security aid to Ukraine, including munitions that can now be fired across the border into Russia to help stabilize a section of the front line.</p><p>The batch is worth an estimated $225 million and is made up of artillery rounds, armored vehicles, patrol boats, anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems and munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS.</p><p>This last system is key for Ukraine, defending against a new offensive on Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city and less than two dozen miles from the border with Russia. In a major policy shift, the U.S. decided late in May to allow Ukraine’s armed forces to hit forces inside Russia that were preparing to attack. They can use HIMARS to do so.</p><p>But that permission is limited to these defensive strikes around Kharkiv — restrictions Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy said last week that he would like to see lifted.</p><p><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/06/03/russian-advance-on-kharkiv-has-slowed-a-bit-us-defense-chief-says/" target="_blank">“Is that sufficient? No,” Zelenskyy said of the policy change.</a></p><p>On Friday Zelenskyy met with U.S. President Joe Biden in Paris, a day after both visited Normandy to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day. In a speech at the Thursday event, Biden affirmed the U.S. commitment to Ukraine’s defense as its forces continue to struggle against Russian attacks in the east.</p><p>“We will not walk away,” Biden said, “because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated.”</p><p>This is the latest round of aid sent to Ukraine since the U.S. passed a further $60 billion in economic and security aid for Kyiv. The largest of those recent packages, though, is $6 billion in long-term assistance through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. Much of the equipment ordered through that package won’t arrive for years.</p><p>“It’s so necessary for the feeling of our people that we are not alone,” Zelenskyy said while meeting with Biden Friday. “We are with you, our strategic partner.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>The Pentagon’s chief information officer will step down from his position at the end of June, the department announced Thursday.</p><p>John Sherman will leave the government gig to become dean of the <a href="https://bush.tamu.edu/">Bush School of Government and Public Service</a> at Texas A&amp;M University.</p><p>Sherman, who served for three years as the intelligence community’s CIO before moving to the Pentagon post in 2021, “has been a steadfast advisor and an innovative leader who has helped the Department adopt and utilize modern information technology to keep our country safe,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin<a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3798517/statement-by-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-on-the-upcoming-departure/" target="_blank"> said in the announcement</a>. “His technical expertise has proven invaluable in tackling a variety of digital challenges. His focus on mission readiness has ensured that each of the services is equipped with both the capabilities and the digital workforce necessary for modern warfighting.”</p><p>Under Sherman, the Defense Department refocused its approach to communications technology, spectrum management, cybersecurity, and positioning, navigation and timing policy. He told Congress last year that the U.S. must “regenerate” its electronic warfare capabilities after years of neglect to ensure dominance on the battlefield.</p><p>“As we <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/05/07/how-dc-became-obsessed-with-a-potential-2027-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan/" target="_blank">get ready for China</a>, we better be able to fight and dominate” the electromagnetic spectrum, he told the House Cyber, Information Technologies, and Innovation Subcommittee at a March 2023 hearing on <a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/hearings/cyber-information-technologies-and-innovation-subcommittee-hearing-defense-digital-era">defense in the digital era</a>.</p><p>“As we’ve seen on the Ukrainian battlefield — all the dynamics with [electromagnetic spectrum operations], of how the Russians are trying to use it, and the Ukrainians are using it — we cannot be cut off on this, to be able to make sure we can conduct combat operations,” <a href="https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/2881098/john-sherman/">Sherman said</a>.</p><p>Sherman was also a strong backer of cybersecurity practices known as zero trust, which he said could have prevented leaks including the 2022 disclosure of the classified reports by a 21-year-old member of the <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2023/04/16/airman-charged-in-pentagon-intel-leak-regretted-joining-the-military/">Massachusetts Air National Guard</a>, if they had been fully instituted at the time.</p><p>“I am grateful for Mr. Sherman’s loyal service to the Department and to our Nation,” Austin said in the statement. “Our national security is stronger today because of his efforts.”</p><p>Sherman, who has also held senior positions in the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, will start in his new role Aug. 1, <a href="https://today.tamu.edu/2024/06/06/veteran-national-intelligence-expert-appointed-dean-of-bush-school/" target="_blank">the university said in a statement.</a></p><p>He’s a distinguished military graduate of Texas A&amp;M with a bachelor’s degree in history. While at the university, he was a Ross volunteer, which performs honor guard duties, and served as commander of the Corps of Cadets. He also earned a Master of Public Administration from the University of Houston.</p><p>After graduating from Texas A&amp;M, Sherman was an air defense officer in the U.S. Army’s 24th Infantry Division.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>SINGAPORE — Sen. Chris Coons’ trip to Singapore last week began with two notable stops.</p><p>The first was Taiwan. Shortly before Coons arrived, China launched a military drill near the island nation, which the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command called a <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/China-s-drills-appear-to-be-rehearsal-for-Taiwan-invasion-U.S.-admiral" target="_blank">“rehearsal” of an invasion</a>.</p><p>The second was to the Philippines, <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/training-sim/2024/06/04/us-philippines-expand-exercise-to-territorial-edges-amid-tension-with-china/" target="_blank">whose vessels face harassment from the Chinese Coast Guard on a regular basis</a> in areas around the South China Sea that both countries claim as their own territory.</p><p>These issues were major topics of discussion at Coons’ last stop — the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia’s largest defense conference.</p><p>The first night of the summit, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said that if China’s military activities killed a Filipino citizen, his government would likely consider it an act of war, which could <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2024/05/31/marcos-sets-red-line-with-beijing-over-south-china-sea-harassment/" target="_blank">draw the U.S. into the conflict</a> given it is allied with the archipelago nation.</p><img src="https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/K8h1087enN17gIxOukZJh183y_Y=/1440x810/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/DAVVTXTTSBGHXFDD35SHU47VJU.jpg" alt="Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., left, prepares to deliver a speech during the Shangri-La Dialogue summit in Singapore on May 31, 2024. (Nhac Nguyen/AFP via Getty Images)" height="810" width="1440"/><p>Two days later, Chinese Defense Minister Adm. Dong Jun <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2024/06/02/chinese-defense-head-warns-of-self-destruction-for-taiwan-supporters/" target="_blank">spent much of his remarks decrying perceived “separatism” from Taiwan</a>, an island nation that China considers a rogue province and has threated to take back by force. Dong warned that the odds of “peaceful reunification” with the island were “eroding.”</p><p>The rhetoric at the Shangri-La Dialogue raised an important question about security in the Indo-Pacific region: Taiwan’s independence and disputed territory in the South China Sea have long been tense subjects, but which is more likely to lead to a conflict?</p><p>That’s a major part of Coons’ job. The Democrat from Delaware sits on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/05/30/money-weapons-and-secret-meetings-what-the-pentagon-is-doing-to-arm-taiwan/" target="_blank">which will help steer $2 billion in new long-term military aid to the region</a>.</p><p>The U.S. is already mapping out where that money will go, along with an additional $1.9 billion in short-term funding. Most of it will head to Taiwan, but how the government divides the entire amount will in part depend on where the threat seems most acute.</p><p>“There are a whole series of conversations underway between the United States and Taiwan, the United States and the Philippines, and a half dozen other regional actors,” Coons said in an interview. “Those conversations should then inform the final downselect in terms of how much for each and for what purpose.”</p><p>“The larger issue,” he added, “is to not let this take too long.”</p><h1>Two threats</h1><p>But how long is too long? Some in Washington have <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/05/07/how-dc-became-obsessed-with-a-potential-2027-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan/" target="_blank">grown increasingly concerned</a> about the chances of a short-term conflict over Taiwan, due in part to <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2023/03/24/why-is-china-strengthening-its-military-its-not-all-about-war/" target="_blank">China’s large military buildup</a> under its leader, Xi Jinping.</p><p>Equipment updates are part of China’s military modernization effort, but training also contributes to that. Its drills around Taiwan have become more aggressive in recent years, and it now regularly breaks the unspoken but once sacrosanct rule to not cross the median line of the Taiwan Strait. Some in Congress and the Pentagon worry the new status quo could make China’s real threat harder to assess.</p><img src="https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/fmojIht6M3jgmFSjBt0HO5BVYKM=/1440x810/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/V4GOBUI4QRABVC6UQ63MPKVPZU.jpg" alt="A Taiwanese armored vehicle rolls down a street in Kinmen on May 24, 2024. China warned that day that Taiwan's leadership was pushing the self-ruled island into "a perilous situation of war and danger" and that it would go "further" if provoked, as Beijing conducted military drills around the territory. (I-Hwa Cheng/AFP via Getty Images)" height="810" width="1440"/><p>Contrast that with the Second Thomas Shoal, a disputed reef in the South China Sea. Beijing claims sovereignty over the area, despite a 2016 ruling from the <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/en/cases/7/" target="_blank">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a>, which invalidated that approach.</p><p>Since last year, China has used Coast Guard ships and other vessels to fire water cannons at and ram Philippine ships, among other means of harassment. Some Philippine ships were damaged under the stress.</p><p>Observers wonder where the Philippines will draw a red line and invoke a mutual defense treaty that the U.S. says it is prepared to fulfill. Marcos didn’t say the death of a Filipino citizen would automatically trigger that deal, but he did say it would be “very close to what we define as an act of war.”</p><p>“A lot of folks agree that Taiwan remains the most important challenge because the escalation potential is so high,” said Greg Poling, an expert on Asian security at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. “But the South China Sea can’t be ignored because it’s got the highest likelihood of escalation, even if it’s relatively low.”</p><p>In response to the different threats, both Taiwan and the Philippines have been upgrading their respective militaries. Many of Taiwan’s goals involve the purchase of American-made weapons through the Pentagons’ Foreign Military Sales program, although a large share of these are taking longer than either party wants.</p><img src="https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/HRZTyp7mx3Mp4QaOEcPdEIJj724=/1440x810/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/F6N6AFYJNFFN5MCAV6FCQD56UY.jpg" alt="Chinese Defense Minister Adm. Dong Jun speaks during the Shangri-La Dialogue summit in Singapore on June 2, 2024. (Nhac Nguyen/AFP via Getty Images)" height="810" width="1440"/><p>Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said there were a total of 22 weapons systems he approved “going back to four years ago” in his position as chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. But those arms “have yet to go out of the country,” he noted during an interview at the Shangri-La Dialogue.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Philippines has <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2023/10/23/philippines-rethinks-military-modernization-plan-after-china-clashes/" target="_blank">modified</a> its military modernization plan amid clashes with Chinese forces, and it also signed a <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3383607/fact-sheet-us-philippines-bilateral-defense-guidelines/" target="_blank">deeper security deal with the U.S. last year</a>. That cooperation has led to larger military exercises between the two countries, <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/training-sim/2024/06/04/us-philippines-expand-exercise-to-territorial-edges-amid-tension-with-china/" target="_blank">including one that finished a few weeks before the conference</a>.</p><h1>‘Two hot wars’</h1><p>To further harden each country’s defenses, the U.S. passed a $95 billion security bill in April. It included about $4 billion in foreign military financing for longer-term arms sales and another $1.9 billion to replace stocks the U.S. sends from its own inventories.</p><p>Coons said he discussed this aid in his meetings with Taiwanese and Filipino officials, including the presidents of both countries.</p><p>The question of how to spend that money depends on several variables. Aside from the sense of urgency related to each threat, Coons said, the U.S. will assess how much equipment each military can absorb in any given point of time.</p><p>That will be harder to answer for the Philippines, which, unlike Taiwan, has received small amounts of American-made materiel in recent years, relatively speaking.</p><p>“Last year the number was $40 million” <a href="https://www.congress.gov.ph/press/details.php?pressid=13015" target="_blank">of financing</a>, Coons said, chuckling as he added: “Somewhere between $40 [million] and $500 million is probably the right number.”</p><p>Another factor is how fast American defense companies can deliver — a topic McCaul raised multiple times, given the U.S. is also supplying two other partners. Arming <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/israel-palestine/" target="_blank">Israel</a> and <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/ukraine/" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> — the former is fighting a war against the militant group Hamas, and the latter is defending itself against a Russian invasion — <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/04/30/soaring-us-munitions-demand-strains-support-for-israel-ukraine-taiwan/" target="_blank">has put a strain on the defense industry</a>.</p><img src="https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/jp9ETZj-HrQgLM7VgYo-0nKGgIQ=/1440x810/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/LSYMPNUZTFB3NEBHLA6SVULE3M.jpg" alt="A Ukrainian soldier places an American-made Javelin missile in a fighting position on the front line on May 20, 2022, in the country's oblast of Kharkiv.

The U.S. now has money to help them, but it’s a limited amount.</p><p>“My view is that we should principally focus on Taiwan and the Philippines right now,” Coons said. “But look, even $20 [million] or $40 million in [foreign military financing] for some of our partners out here would be significant.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>U.S. adversaries around the world are deploying “formidable” electronic warfare tools, and the Pentagon must either find ways to dominate the electromagnetic spectrum or prepare its forces to operate in contested or even denied environments, officials said at the <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/smr/conference/" target="_blank">C4ISRNET Conference</a>.</p><p>“I think the biggest takeaway is that our near-peer adversaries, and then elements like Hamas, have formidable EW capabilities,” Brig. Gen. Ed Barker, the Army’s program executive officer for intelligence, electronic warfare and sensors, said during Wednesday’s virtual event. “It’s really about making sure that our systems, our soldiers and our commanders have that kind of freedom of maneuver within the EMS.”</p><p>The electromagnetic spectrum, or EMS, consists of the energy waves produced from radios, cellphones, radars and the like. The EMS environment has become highly contested, presenting a difficult battle space in which actors are vying for dominance.</p><p>Maintaining situational awareness is necessary for military commanders to communicate and guide weapons to their targets. EMS is becoming increasingly used by U.S. adversaries such as <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/ukraine/" target="_blank">Russia in its war against Ukraine</a>, the militant group <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/israel-palestine/" target="_blank">Hamas in Gaza</a> and the Yemen-based <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2024/02/12/all-the-houthi-us-navy-incidents-in-the-middle-east-that-we-know-of/" target="_blank">Houthi rebel group in its attack on ships in the Red Sea</a>.</p><p>It comes down to a select few advanced capabilities facing off against “non-exquisite capabilities in mass,” Barker said. “And sometimes, you know, that mass can be quite overwhelming.”</p><p>“We’re realizing we have to build essentially an EW arsenal across the landscape to be able to go at these different types of threats,” he added.</p><p>At the same conference, Col. Josh Koslov, the head of the Air Force’s 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing, said interoperability among low-cost weapon systems will help hold the line in electronic warfare.</p><p>“They have to be able to talk to each other,” he said. “And so if we fight a near-peer tonight, we’re going to fight with the capabilities we have today. And so how do we make the systems that we have today more interoperable and able to share information, and then the systems that we’re bringing online?”</p><p>Koslov added that “super close” alignment between the warfighter and acquisition “is incredibly important as we move forward, and then making sure that we’re developing the requirements that drive interoperability from the beginning.” This means a reduced focus on major weapon systems, and more of a focus on the data that those weapon systems use, he noted.</p><p>He pointed to the use of low-cost tools that “create strategic and operational impacts” in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, adding that the U.S. needs to develop a system capable of countering that approach.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>
                <![CDATA[<p>The Defense Department in recent years has taken a more targeted approach to connecting forces across operational domains — and, according to military leaders and outside experts, it’s starting to yield results.</p><p>In the early days of the Defense Department’s pursuit of Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or CJADC2, the focus was on full interoperability among and within all of the military services. Bryan Clark, director of the Hudson Institute’s Center for Defense Concepts and Technology, said the vision, while well-intentioned, was too broad in its scope.</p><p>“That was a little bit too ambitious for what the technology and our requirements and acquisition process can achieve,” he said June 5 at a virtual C4ISRNET Conference. “I think by building it from the bottom up to a larger aggregation, we’re going to see more success with JADC2 going forward.”</p><p>That bottom-up approach, Clark said, has meant that rather than try to connect everything, the department is addressing the most urgent operational problems through joint and service-level experimentation campaigns.</p><p>The military services each have their own versions of this. The Army calls its approach Project Convergence, the Navy Project Overmatch and the Air Force has the Advanced Battle Management System. The Chief Digital and AI Office also holds regular technology sprints <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/opinions/2023/12/20/how-the-cdaos-gide-series-is-bringing-benefits-of-ai-to-the-pentagon/" target="_blank">through an event known as the Global Information Dominance Experiment</a>, which bring together the services, combatant commands, Joint Staff and international partners to test out CJADC2 capabilities.</p><p>In February, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced the Defense Department had delivered a baseline CJADC2 capability <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/c2-comms/2024/02/21/pentagon-achieves-minimum-viable-version-of-cjadc2-hicks-says/" target="_blank">that was validated through a GIDE event held late last year</a>. The department hasn’t revealed specifics on what was fielded but Hicks said it was improving<a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/c2-comms/2024/02/22/pentagons-cjadc2-milestone-is-signal-to-china-officials-say/" target="_blank"> information-sharing in the field</a>.</p><p>Mark Kitz, the Army’s program executive officer for command, control, communications-tactical, said during the conference that experiments like GIDE and Project Convergence have helped highlight the sensor-to-shooter connections that are highest priority for the services.</p><p>They’ve also led to a heightened focus on interoperability, which has yielded some tangible results, he said.</p><p>For example, during the most recent Project Convergence event that wrapped up in March, known as Capstone 4, the Army and the Navy directly integrated their kit and were able to bring together their data environments.</p><p>“And so, Project Convergence offered sort of this real opportunity for us to bring these capabilities together in a real operational way and . . . get through sort of the challenges of data interoperability,” Kitz said.</p><p>During the same exercise, the Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management team, led by Brig. Gen. Luke Cropsey, brought a tool that allows the service to see how its air picture integrates with its sensing environment — a capability that could directly benefit the Army.</p><p>“The investments that Gen. Cropsey and his team were making were directly related to a gap in the Army’s architecture,” Kitz said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>If the Defense Department expects to maintain a competitive edge in cyber warfare and other emerging technologies on the digital battlefield, then it has to be able to develop these tools quickly — something that can be difficult in a bureaucratic environment.</p><p>As it so often does, the U.S. government is looking to the private sector for inspiration, and it’s seeing commercial partners leveraging these tools already, officials from the U.S. military and the Pentagon said at the 2024 C4ISRNET Conference on Wednesday. That’s in no small part due to the fact that many of these companies have the workforce on hand to use them and can recruit competitively on pay.</p><p>“We have seen Big Tech and large tech companies embracing some of these tools, and they’re moving out with it because they see the value in these methods,” said Benjamin Bishop, deputy director of transition in the Adaptive Capabilities Office of DARPA. “But a lot of those companies ... can pay salaries for this talent that may not translate to other companies in the defense industrial base because their focus area is different.”</p><p>There’s also a need, he said, to make these capabilities accessible not just to certifying organizations and those with specialized training or expertise, but to the broader workforce to move U.S. military strategy forward holistically. And it needs to happen fast enough so that the latest technology is not mired in acquisition regulation and rendered obsolete.</p><p>“How do we navigate the the non-technical barriers to our transition?” said Bishop. “How do we get the tools into the hands of the warfighters in order to maximize their success?”</p><p>The proliferation of digital threats in recent years has forced cybersecurity to become the responsibility of every Pentagon office, civilian and military. Bishop noted that the cyber-contested environment is rapidly become a standard character of war, and the Biden Administration, too, has set top-down goals for every aspect of government to be equipped with security measures in place, whether they contribute directly to national defense or not.</p><p><a href="https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2024/06/04/marines-fast-track-qualified-cyber-signals-recruits-to-rank-of-gunny/">Marines fast track qualified cyber, signals recruits to rank of gunny</a></p><p>“To me, that’s not necessarily a technology problem,” said Bishop. “How do we get the technology to be ... understood by the systems that have to certify these products, but also understood by the workforce that’s across our defense industrial base and also in uniform?”</p><p>And while partnering with the private sector can and does work, the military itself must develop its own cyber expertise, he said.</p><p>On top of trying to meet general manpower goals, the services, too, are<a href="https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2024/04/25/air-force-opens-applications-for-warrant-officer-jobs-in-cyber-it/" target="_blank"> recruiting cyber experts </a>to their ranks and contend with how to compensate them uniformly despite different pay scales, [Military Occupation Specialty] titles, and promotion processes, according to Bishop.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>The<a href="https://www.darpa.mil/" target="_blank"> Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency </a>is working to push tools it’s developing to automatically prove that software is secure out to the commercial sector and help companies overcome the cumbersome Pentagon verification process, according to Benjamin Bishop, deputy director of transition in the agency’s Adaptive Capabilities Office,</p><p>“One of the things that we hear from the warfighter is we’ll have a technology solution that is available, but getting it through that process to have the authority to operate and be able to get it through the approval process is very laborious,” Bishop said Wednesday said at the annual <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/smr/conference/" target="_blank">C4ISRNet conference</a>. “I will add, for good reason, because in the past these DOD steps have shown improvement to generate a higher quality solution.”</p><p>While humans doing math can prove software works as it’s designed, there are tools that can look at file metadata, which contains proof that the software is secure, and automatically verify its safety, he explained at the virtual event.</p><p>DARPA’s program Automated Rapid Certification of Software, or ARCOS, is working on developing that capability, Bishop said. The goal of the program is to automate the evaluation of software assurance evidence to enable certifiers to determine rapidly that system risk is acceptable, <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/automated-rapid-certification-of-software" target="_blank">according to the agency. </a></p><p>The capability is viable, he added, but “what I’m really interested in is not just that it’s technically viable, but we can we do it in a way that can be adopted across the DOD ecosystem?”</p><p>In order to do so, the DOD will need to provide incentive for commercial partners to use it, Bishop noted.</p><p>“We have seen big tech or large tech companies are embracing some of these tools and they’re moving out with it because they see the value in these methods,” according to Bishop.</p><p>Another element in developing such a capability is ensuring its user friendliness. “Are there ways that we can get these tools, not only to be able to be acceptable by the certifying organizations but can they be used by people that don’t have PhDs,” Bishop said, “to be able to navigate these tools.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>The House defense spending panel on Wednesday advanced the first draft of its annual Pentagon funding bill over objections from Democrats, who cited a provision that would block the president’s authority to withhold arms transfers to Israel and a lack of security assistance for Ukraine, among other partisan provisions.</p><p>The $833 billion defense appropriations bill for fiscal 2025 would bar the Pentagon from using funds “to withhold, halt, reverse or cancel the delivery of defense articles or defense services” for Israel, and force the president to transfer withheld weapons to the Israeli military within 15 days.</p><p>The bill also drops an annual $300 million in Ukraine security aid that defense appropriators have provided since 2014; revives <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2023/06/16/republican-defense-bill-would-move-mexico-under-us-southern-command/" target="_blank">an effort to move Mexico from U.S. Northern Command to U.S. Southern Command</a>; and <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2023/08/31/gop-defense-bill-bars-pentagon-from-enacting-bidens-climate-orders/" target="_blank">bans the Pentagon from implementing President Joe Biden’s executive orders on climate change</a>.</p><p>“Why, after this Congress has repeatedly demonstrated broad bipartisan support for Ukraine in its fight against Russian tyranny, are we considering a bill that fails to fund the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative?” Rep.

The last president to publicly withhold weapons shipments to Israel was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/us/politics/biden-reagan-israel.html" target="_blank">Ronald Reagan</a> in 1982 after seeing pictures of civilians killed in Lebanon.</p><p>Biden said he withheld the shipment in April, which includes 500- and 2,000-pound bombs, out of concern Israel would use them in Rafah, where more than half of the Gaza Strip’s population have fled since the Israeli campaign against the militant group Hamas started in October. Nonetheless, he has approved <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/04/09/israel-f-15-sale-in-jeopardy-as-congressional-support-wanes/" target="_blank">several other arms transfers for Israel</a>.</p><p>Despite warnings from the White House, Israel proceeded with its Rafah offensive, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/24/g-s1-741/rafah-gaza-israel-hamas-war" target="_blank">displacing roughly 1 million Palestinians</a> and <a href="https://www.msf.org/gaza-thousands-forced-flee-israeli-military-offensive-intensifies-and-aid-blocked-rafah" target="_blank">further curtailing humanitarian aid deliveries</a>.</p><p>In addition to the bill’s annual $500 million in aid for Israeli missile defenses, the FY25 legislation provides $80 million above the president’s budget request for anti-tunneling cooperation with the U.S. and another $55 million above the budget request for counter-drone development, including “directed energy and laser technology cooperation.”</p><p>The State Department spending bill for FY25, which the foreign aid panel advanced Tuesday, also includes Israel’s annual $3.3 billion in foreign military financing. And the foreign aid bill Congress passed in April includes another $14 billion in Israel military aid.</p><p>Both the FY25 Pentagon and State Department spending bills ban funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, which delivers humanitarian assistance in the Gaza Strip, drawing further ire from McCollum.</p><p>“According to a March report from the World Food Program, nearly half the population — over 1 million people — have completely exhausted their food supplies,” she said Wednesday. “Palestinian civilians, many of them children, are struggling with catastrophic hunger and starvation.”</p><p>Other policy riders Democrats oppose include moving jurisdiction of U.S. military operations with Mexico to Southern Command — a bid that failed last year. Calvert and Republicans argue that moving Mexico to Southern Command would better enable counter-fentanyl trafficking operations against Mexican drug cartels.</p><p>Additionally, the bill would ban the Pentagon from using funds to implement Biden’s climate executive orders, including one that would prevent the Defense Department — the world’s largest institutional fossil fuel emitter — from disclosing carbon emissions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>PARIS — Kelly Magsamen, who has served as chief of staff to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin his entire tenure, will step down at the end of June.</p><p>Austin announced the change in a statement, crediting her for “every initiative I have launched to defend our nation,” which includes work in the three areas of the world that now consume the Pentagon’s attention: the Indo-Pacific region, Europe and the Middle East.</p><p>Magsamen’s last week has been an illustration of that split. She joined Austin for the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia’s largest defense conference, where he met with world leaders and in particular China’s new defense minister. Then she joined him for trips to Cambodia — where she sat beside him in meetings with the country’s leadership — and Paris, where Austin is staying during the 80th anniversary ceremony of D-Day.</p><p>Another defining part of her time in office was when Austin was hospitalized earlier this year after complications from a surgery to treat prostate cancer. <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2024/01/08/austin-chief-of-staff-failed-to-tell-anyone-about-his-hospitalization/" target="_blank">Magsamen did not inform others in the Pentagon nor the U.S. government — including the president</a>. The Pentagon has since explained the delay by saying she was also sick, and Austin took the blame for the delay, <a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/hearings/full-committee-hearing-review-defense-secretary-austin-s-unannounced-absence" target="_blank">sitting for a grilling in front of the House Armed Services Committee in February.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3687475/department-releases-unclassified-review-summary-following-austins-hospitalizati/" target="_blank">A review of the incident</a> ordered by Austin recommended protocol changes but didn’t result in staff discipline.</p><p>Magsamen has worked across Washington’s national security institutions, including previous stints at the State Department and the National Security Council.</p><p>“Kelly’s leadership, counsel, and selfless service made our nation safer, made the lives of our people better and more rewarding, and rendered the heavy burden of this office of mine a good bit lighter,” Austin said in the statement.</p><p>Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh didn’t say where Magsamen is headed, only that the chief of staff is “taking time off before she pursues other opportunities.”</p><p>Caroline Zier, Magsamen’s deputy, will serve as acting chief of staff after Magsamen steps down, according to Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the department’s press secretary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>As more governments and commercial companies look to proliferated satellite constellations for increased capacity, some defense experts are concerned that these large fleets could be providing cover for space weapons or spy satellites.</p><p>A Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency effort aims to use artificial intelligence to shine a light on those potentially nefarious capabilities.</p><p>In 2023, DARPA selected <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/space/2022/09/13/california-company-promises-free-crash-avoidance-tool-for-spacecraft/" target="_blank">Slingshot Aerospace</a>, a California-based space technology firm, to create an AI system that identifies anomalous satellites within these large constellations. The company unveiled its model, dubbed Agatha, on June 5, announcing that it had demonstrated the ability to detect outlier satellites among operational constellations.</p><p>“Identifying malfunctioning or potentially nefarious objects and their objectives within large satellite constellations is a complex challenge that required us to reach beyond traditional approaches and develop a novel and scalable AI algorithm,” Dylan Kesler, Slingshot’s director of data science and AI, said in a statement. “Our Agatha model has also proven its ability to deliver high-quality insights that provide ‘explainability’ or context for why specific objects were flagged.”</p><p>The Chinese government has announced plans to launch two megaconstellations in the coming years comprised of tens of thousands of satellites, a bid to rival Elon Musk’s SpaceX,<a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/space/2023/09/15/how-two-satcom-companies-are-responding-to-starlinks-dominance/" target="_blank"> whose network of Starlink communication satellites</a> includes more than 6,000 operational spacecraft.</p><p>At the same time, Defense Department officials have confirmed Russia is developing a satellite that could carry a nuclear weapon and last month launched a counterspace weapon designed to follow U.S. spy satellites.</p><p>Audrey Schaffer, Slingshot’s vice president of strategy and policy, told C4ISRNET these developments make a tool like Agatha particularly important.</p><p>“Agatha is one example of a technology that is designed to help see clearly in that kind of increasingly crowded and congested environment,” she said. “In particular, Agatha really helps you find that needle in the haystack.”</p><p>To train Agatha’s algorithm, Slingshot fed more than 60 years of data from simulated megaconstellations created by the firm. Those constellations included outlier satellites, which allowed Agatha to distinguish between types of satellites and flag anomalies.</p><p>The system incorporates a method known as inverse reinforcement learning. The technique allows Agatha to not only recognize and track anomalous spacecraft maneuvers or other activity but to assign motivation to those actions.</p><p>“Agatha doesn’t just identify that this particular satellite is an outlier,” Schaffer said. “It can also make an assessment of why the satellite is behaving differently than the other satellites in the constellation and what policies or operational directives it might be following that explain the difference in behavior.”</p><p>Once it had trained the model, Slingshot set out to test Agatha’s abilities using existing commercial constellations. Schaffer wouldn’t identify which companies’ satellites the system observed, but said it flagged several non-nefarious anomalies, which it then confirmed with the spacecraft owners.</p><p>The DARPA-led project wrapped up earlier this year, and Schaffer said the company is now in conversations with potential government and commercial customers who may be interested in Agatha. She noted that the tool could be useful to U.S. Space Command, <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/space/2022/04/08/spacecom-requests-more-funding-for-key-space-domain-awareness-center/" target="_blank">National Space Defense Center</a> monitors activities in space.</p><p>“The amount of traffic in space is only growing,” she said. When you have not just 10,000 satellites that are active but 10,000 satellites in a single constellation, it is very quickly going to be impossible for humans or even teams of humans to sift through all that data and identify potential threats to our national security.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>The House’s annual Pentagon spending bill only funds the procurement of one Virginia-class attack submarine for fiscal 2025 instead of two vessels as it has in previous years.</p><p>The draft spending bill, released Tuesday, overrides legislation the <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/05/23/house-advances-884-billion-defense-bill-with-enlisted-troop-pay-raise/" target="_blank">House Armed Services Committee advanced last month</a>, which authorized partial funding for a second Virginia-class submarine. Instead, defense appropriators in the House have sided with <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2024/03/11/us-navy-nixed-a-virginia-sub-amid-spending-frenzy-to-support-suppliers/" target="_blank">the Navy, which requested funding for just one attack submarine this year</a> citing production delays amid industrial base constraints.</p><p>“We have to rebuild the industrial base in order for us to build submarines,” House defense appropriations chairman Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told Defense News. “I want more submarines. But in order for us to get there, we have to rebuild the industrial base to get the necessary workforce to build the submarines. So we’re focusing on fixing the problem in order for us to build more submarines.”</p><p>The decision comes despite intense pressure from a large, bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn. They have lobbied defense appropriators to fund two submarines, arguing that only funding one submarine would adversely affect companies further down the supply chain.</p><p>“House Republicans’ first take at the defense appropriations FY25 bill will never become law,” Courtney said in a statement. “Aside from its hyper-partisan policy riders, it does not reflect the stated need of combatant commanders, the [FY25 National Defense Authorization Act], which advanced 57-1, and <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/05/01/house-lawmakers-denounce-pentagons-planned-drop-in-submarine-orders/" target="_blank">the will of 133 Democrats and Republicans who requested steady Virginia-class funding</a>.”</p><p>The defense appropriations bill allocates $3.6 billion for a Virginia-class submarine as well as $3.7 billion in advance procurement funding to continue buying long-lead time materials for future attack submarines. The Navy hopes that the advance procurement funding will sustain vendors in the meantime.</p><p>But, Courtney argued, the bill “also does nothing to support the supply chain companies that do not receive advanced procurement funding, leaving many suppliers in the industrial base uncertain about future business.”</p><p>Courtney is the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee’s seapower panel, and his Connecticut district includes General Dynamics Electric Boat, which makes the Virginia-class submarines.</p><p>The Armed Services Committee <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2024/05/13/house-armed-services-committee-adds-second-virginia-submarine-in-fy25/" target="_blank">authorized $1 billion in incremental funding for a second Virginia-class vessel</a> in its FY25 National Defense Authorization Act, which the House is scheduled to vote on next week. That money will not be available for industry unless congressional appropriators opt to include it in their spending legislation.</p><p>Courtney and Rep. <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2024/05/15/wittman-sure-us-navy-will-buy-two-attack-subs-in-2025-like-it-or-not/" target="_blank">Rob Wittman</a>, R-Va., recently led 131 other lawmakers in a letter to defense appropriators beseeching them to fund two Virginia-class submarines against the Pentagon’s wishes.</p><p>“Preserving a consistent production schedule is essential for shipyard and industrial base stability, and to meet the Navy’s operational requirements,” the lawmakers wrote in a May letter to Calvert and Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., the panel’s top Democrat.</p><p>While industry works to overcome production delays stemming from labor shortages and lingering pandemic-related supply chain shocks, the Navy assesses that it needs to build two Virginia-class vessels and one Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine to meet its fleet requirements.</p><p>The AUKUS agreement, in which the U.S. will transfer at least three and as many as five attack submarines to Australia in the next decade, would <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2023/09/14/aukus-agreement-requires-submarine-production-boost-franchetti-says/">require a production boost of 2.3 to 2.5 Virginia-class vessels</a> per year, on average.</p><p>The $833 billion defense spending bill includes $31.6 billion in the shipbuilding budget to procure four battle force ships.</p><p>It includes another $4 billion in funding to continue bolstering the submarine industrial base. Congress allocated another $3.3 billion in submarine industrial base funding when <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2024/04/24/congress-sends-ukraine-israel-taiwan-aid-package-to-presidents-desk/" target="_blank">it passed its massive foreign aid bill in April</a>.</p><p>The Senate is expected to mark up its version of the FY25 National Defense Authorization Act next week, and senators have not yet released their FY25 defense spending bill.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>House lawmakers want to allocate more than $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025 toward Pentagon initiatives such as the Defense Innovation Unit — part of a continued push from Congress to field commercial technology at a faster clip.</p><p>The House Appropriations defense subcommittee’s draft of FY25 military spending legislation, released June 4, would add more than $500 million for DIU initiatives to quickly deliver capabilities that meet urgent needs from combatant commands and the services. The bill would also expand access to classified facilities for the innovation hub and the non-traditional companies it works with.</p><p>Another $400 million would support a Pentagon effort to fast-track technology from small business to military users, known as Accelerate the Procurement and Fielding of Innovative Technologies, or APFIT. Congress provided $300 million for the project in fiscal 2024, which funded capabilities including a mobile communications gateway for the Navy and optical clocks for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</p><p>The bill, which the committee is slated to debate June 5, would continue a <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/2023/06/23/house-panel-eyes-billion-dollar-pentagon-fund-to-push-commercial-tech/" target="_blank">campaign from House appropriators</a> to ensure that the Department of Defense has more resources to back up its stated objective to better leverage innovation in the private sector.</p><p>In FY24, a provision from the defense panel <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/2024/03/21/defense-innovation-unit-would-get-major-funding-boost-in-spending-bill/" target="_blank">calling for an $800 million increase to DIU appropriations</a> made it into law. Along with providing a financial boost, the legislation gave the organization more authority to drive DoD’s innovation fielding efforts.</p><p>At the Pentagon, <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/2023/12/04/pentagons-commercial-tech-arm-to-ramp-up-role-in-military-innovation/" target="_blank">DIU’s influence has grown in recent years</a>. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last year elevated the unit to report directly to his office and named Doug Beck, a former Apple executive, to lead it.</p><p>Beck now sits on the Deputy’s Innovation Steering Group, which oversees DoD efforts to rapidly field technology to address high-need operational problems. DIU is also playing a key role in Replicator — an effort to field thousands of drones by next summer and develop a process for quickly delivering capabilities to military users.</p><p>DIU is working now to <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/unmanned/2024/04/23/defense-innovation-unit-prepares-to-execute-800-million-funding-boost/" target="_blank">craft a spending plan for the funding</a> it received in FY24 which, due to prolonged budget deliberations, came more than five months into the fiscal year.</p><p>The organization plans to distribute the money across four primary buckets: accelerating existing programs, launching new ones, supporting projects housed within other Defense Department innovation organizations and addressing some of the challenges commercial companies face as they try to work with DOD.</p>]]></content:encoded>
